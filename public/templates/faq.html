            What happens after the Local Round?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The winning team needs to confirm to the local organisers within 10 days after the Local Round is finished whether they will attend the Final Round. If no confirmation takes place or the team cancels, then the 2nd winning team will be promoted to the Final Round. However, the winning team can maintain all the awards from the Local Round, with the exception of travel reimbursement (if applicable) that will be awarded to the team that will proceed to the Final Round.</p>

            Participants’ cancellation
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If the cancellations takes place, more than 10 days  before the inauguration of Final Round, then the process of the previous question is followed. </p>
            <p>The winning teams that are proceeding to the Final Round should be consisted of three members each.</p>
            <p>If one member of a local winning team cannot attend the Final Round, then the team is allowed to proceed to the Final Round, but may not introduce any new/substitute member for the one that has cancelled. The remaining members of the team need to confirm within a week whether they will proceed or not. If no confirmation takes place within a week, then the whole team will be disqualified.</p>
            <p>If more than one contestant is not attending the Final Round, that exact team will not proceed, but the second-winning one will.</p>
            <p>In case there is a cancellation, please, note that the criteria for all teams will remain the same during the Final Round.</p>
